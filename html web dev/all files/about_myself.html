    <p>Hello! My name is Md kaif . I am a 3rd-semester metallurgy student from India with a passion for learning and growing. 
        I am currently exploring web development and have completed C++ with a strong grasp of object-oriented programming, functions, and recursion. 
        I dedicate my time to mastering JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as I aim to create custom websites and freelance on platforms like Fiverr. 
        Outside academics, I enjoy vegetarian food, studying solid-state physics, and delving into forex trading.</p>
